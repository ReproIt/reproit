# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here. ReproIt follows semantic
versioning for the stable CLI surface, saved repro contract, wire protocol, and
versioned SDK source APIs documented in `docs/stability.md`.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-22

### Added

- One CLI workflow across web, mobile, desktop, terminal, Electron, Tauri,
  Dear ImGui, and Clay targets.
- Confirmed finding replay, minimization, saved regression suites, evidence
  recording, and production bug replay.
- Version 1 event batches shared by the CLI, runners, Cloud, and production SDKs.
- Checksummed CLI and SDK archives, plus installer smoke tests, for every 1.0
  platform.
- Hosted Cloud ingest, account, project, capture, replay-package, and CLI
  production-loop validation.
- Independent Chromium application evidence against fixed public VERT and
  Slidev issues.

### Stability contract

- Existing 1.x `reproit.yaml` files, saved repros, event batches, and the command
  behavior named in `docs/stability.md` remain compatible throughout 1.x unless
  a security fix requires a narrowly documented exception.
- Experimental specialist or backend-contract features are outside the stable
  API and are identified as experimental where documented.
