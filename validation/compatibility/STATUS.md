## Flutter Android

- Maturity: Stable
- Scope: Flutter profile-mode builds on a reset Android emulator, driven through Appium
  UiAutomator2. A release APK is AOT compiled with no Dart VM service; a profile APK exposes the
  service, but its tree dumps carry nothing and evaluate is refused, so the observable is read from
  the platform accessibility hierarchy that attaching a UiAutomation makes Flutter generate. Every
  one of those facts was measured rather than assumed

## macOS Accessibility

- Maturity: Preview

- Promotion standard: schema-3

- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. 9 candidate defects across 5
    independent applications are qualified with verified revisions, but none has three clean
    affected reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls. An execution attempt on
    2026-08-01 got no further than the first launch: see the environment-unreachable blocker below,
    which is now the input this one waits on
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target
  - [environment-unreachable] the campaign cannot be executed on the only permissioned macOS host,
    and this is the same fault that stalls the required-CI runner rather than a second one. This
    host's syspolicyd has been pinned near 98 percent CPU since 6 July, and it performs Gatekeeper
    assessment, so any Mach-O file that has not been assessed at its current path stalls in
    _dyld_start at 0 percent CPU indefinitely. Ten bounded launches separate what runs from what
    does not: signing, ad-hoc re-signing, architecture, the Rosetta path, the directory, and the
    process that wrote the file all make no difference, and cp of a system binary that runs
    instantly in place also stalls at its new path, so the assessment is keyed on the file rather
    than on the code. It reaches builds too, not only launches: an xcodebuild of Platypus compiled
    and then stopped in a run-script phase with /bin/sh itself stuck in _dyld_start. No application
    can therefore be built or launched, so no reproduction run of any kind is possible. Nothing here
    disqualifies any of the 9 candidates: none was built, no accessibility tree was dumped, and no
    revision pair was tested for discrimination. Repairing syspolicyd needs root

  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required application campaigns is complete, and the corpus
    is retained and passing. joplin, issue 15972, affected 7d90db0b and fixed 2fa45a5a, ran on
    disposable iPhone 16 Pro simulators on iOS 26.2: three affected reproductions all landing on
    react-native-layout:note-row-padding-outside-touch-target with the note row hit area measured at
    370 by 20 and the tap at (201, 118) swallowed, three fixed controls all reaching the same
    observation with the hit area at 402 by 52 and the identical coordinate opening the note,
    neighbouring legal behaviour holding on both revisions, and the owned simulator deleted. The
    corpus is one clean and two adversarial subjects with zero false positives. The second
    application is what remains: BlueWallet is excluded outright because a pinned dependency
    repository returns 404, and streetwriters/notesnook is selected. Its defect is JavaScript, so
    the trigger and the observable proven on Android carry over unchanged: issue 7348, affected
    14f727d6 and fixed 7c3fdab6, one note relinked from notebook Alpha to Beta in single-select
    mode, where the affected build leaves the note in both. Its iOS build is the missing input. The
    bootstrap recipe is now known and is the project's own, npm ci --ignore-scripts then npm run
    bootstrap -- --scope=mobile then npm run tx mobile:build, without which the bundle cannot
    resolve @notesnook/intl. It did not complete on this host: syspolicyd has been wedged near a
    full core since 6 July, a sampled /bin/sh script phase sat in _dyld_start having executed no
    instruction, and the bootstrap and the xcodebuild script phases both stall there repeatedly

  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required independent application campaigns is executed. cc-
    switch issue 4302 has three clean affected reproductions on one identity, three reached-
    observation fixed controls, a minimized trigger, and both controls, and the clean and
    adversarial corpus now measures the oracle on known-good subjects. The second application is
    missing for a measured reason, not an untried one: this probe observes only the WebKitGTK
    webview DOM, and readest and note-gen both need a native GTK window, readest to seed a library
    and note-gen to observe a file chooser. readest builds in the worker and its argv path was
    measured to open books transiently without importing them, so its library cannot be seeded
    through this channel

A Stable target requires exact-commit native evidence, two independent
affected-versus-fixed applications, three clean affected reproductions,
three reached-observation fixed controls, exact identity preservation,
verified minimization, and neighboring legal behavior. Targets on the
schema-3 standard additionally require a clean corpus, an adversarial
corpus, a clean package installation, and a confirmed manual review.
