## Flutter Android

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: Flutter profile-mode builds on a reset Android emulator. A release APK is AOT compiled with
  no Dart VM service, and a profile APK exposes the service for tree dumps and IO profiles but
  neither expression evaluation nor the widget inspector. Both facts were measured rather than
  assumed
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: flutter-android
- Field benchmark: incomplete
- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none
- Operating systems: android-emulator
- Architectures: x86_64
- Runtimes: Dart VM service (profile-mode build, dump and profile RPCs only), flutter drive
- Frameworks: Flutter
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. Both revisions of LocalSend now
    build profile APKs on the x86_64 executor and the profile observation channel is measured, but
    no scenario, no three affected reproductions and no three fixed controls exist. The scenario
    must observe through a tree dump or an IO profile: the profile build registers 26 extension RPCs
    including debugDumpApp, debugDumpRenderTree and the semantics dumps, exposes no widget
    inspector, and refuses evaluate with 'Debugger is disabled in AOT mode'
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target
  - [environment-unreachable] the campaign host has no x86_64 Android system image, so the arch
    bound is satisfied only on the lane's own x86_64 executor (black@zgx-5a09.local then strix).
    That executor is now proven for this target: both LocalSend revisions build profile APKs for
    android-x64 there and the lane's AVD recipe boots an x86_64 API 36 emulator inside the worker
    image. What is not yet built there is the campaign runner itself, so no scenario has run

## Flutter iOS

- Maturity: Stable
- Scope: Flutter on a disposable iOS simulator through flutter drive
- Promotion standard: schema-3

## Linux GTK

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: x86_64 Linux container with AT-SPI on GTK
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: linux-atspi-gtk
- Field benchmark: incomplete
- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none
- Operating systems: linux-container
- Architectures: x86_64

- Frameworks: GTK 3, GTK 4
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. 5 candidate defects across 4
    application(s) are qualified with verified revisions, but none has three clean affected
    reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls
  - [incomplete-evidence] only one of the five qualified candidates is admissible to the benchmark
    record. validation/field/check-benchmark.py accepts a GitHub HTTPS repository and a GitHub issue
    URL and nothing else, and four of the five candidates live on gitlab.gnome.org. rnote is the
    single GitHub-hosted subject, so a second GitHub-hosted GTK 4 application with a verified
    affected and fixed pair must be mined, or the benchmark and corpus validators must be extended
    to accept a named set of additional forges
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

    application(s) are qualified with verified revisions, but none has three clean affected

  - [incomplete-evidence] none of the five qualified candidates is admissible to the benchmark
    record. validation/field/check-benchmark.py accepts a GitHub HTTPS repository and a GitHub issue
    URL and nothing else, and all five candidates live on invent.kde.org with bugs.kde.org issue
    ids. Two GitHub-hosted Qt Quick applications with verified affected and fixed pairs must be
    mined, or the benchmark and corpus validators must be extended to accept a named set of
    additional forges
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

## Linux Qt Widgets

## Linux wxWidgets

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: x86_64 Linux container with AT-SPI on wxWidgets
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: linux-atspi-toolkits
- Field benchmark: incomplete
- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none
- Operating systems: linux-container
- Architectures: x86_64
- Runtimes: AT-SPI 2, GTK backend
- Frameworks: wxWidgets
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. 5 candidate defects across 5
    application(s) are qualified with verified revisions, but none has three clean affected
    reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls
  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required applications now has a worker image and a proven
    trigger and the other has neither. wxMaxima compiles at e5c410e884c3f1b24c54ac1179c16c3cf0283247
    and 684d2ed4e106fc0fc174f5537129bfd13ba68b93 in an x86_64 bookworm container, and the retained
    AT-SPI records show the Greek Letters view check menu item reporting checked on the affected
    revision and unchecked on the fixed one from a clean profile. What is missing is a second
    independent application: validation/field/linux-wxwidgets/ carries only the wxMaxima subject,
    and no benchmark record exists because a complete benchmark needs exactly two
  - [incomplete-evidence] the second application is chosen and its build is proven, but its probe is
    unwritten. poedit c4fe890ef72c8c8cbc6b9b8cc1784dba10447798 configures and links a real binary on
    Debian trixie with libwxgtk3.2-dev plus libwxgtk-webview3.2-dev and --without-cpprest --without-
    cld2; bookworm cannot host it because configure demands wxWidgets 3.2.4. Its observation channel
    is also settled by reading src/fileviewer.cpp at that revision: FileViewer::ShowError paints a
    wxStaticText reading 'Source code not found' when GetFilename resolves nothing, which is exactly
    what the empty BeforeLast(':') produces for a reference carrying no line number. What remains is
    a two-distribution worker image, a .po fixture whose entry references a source file without a
    line number, and three affected plus three fixed runs
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

    positive rate is measured for this target

    independent applications (BlueWallet, Joplin) are qualified with verified revisions, but neither
    has three clean affected reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls

- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. 10 candidate defects across 6
    independent applications are qualified with verified revisions. Four applications have now been
    built and driven on disposable simulators: damus and Aidoku return the fixed behavior on their
    affected revisions on both installed runtimes and are excluded, IceCubesApp does not build under
    the Xcode 26.2 Swift compiler, and dimeApp has a proven ad-hoc signed launch recipe but no
    executed trigger. Both kiwix-apple candidates remain unbuilt. No application has three clean
    affected reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

## Tauri Linux

  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required independent application campaigns is executed,
    with a clean and adversarial corpus behind its oracle. The second application is reachable but
    not executed: the worker now has a second observation channel, AT-SPI for native windows, which
    is fixture-proven and imports fourteen books through readest's real GTK chooser. Two inputs
    remain: the element readest marks when a row is selected, since neither className nor computed
    background-color changes, and a Next.js export that is not SIGKILLed by the 8 GB Docker VM

A Stable target requires exact-commit native evidence, two independent
affected-versus-fixed applications, three clean affected reproductions,
three reached-observation fixed controls, exact identity preservation,
verified minimization, and neighboring legal behavior. Targets on the
schema-3 standard additionally require a clean corpus, an adversarial
corpus, a clean package installation, and a confirmed manual review.
