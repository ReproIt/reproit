## Flutter Android

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: Flutter profile-mode builds on a reset Android emulator. A release APK is AOT compiled with
  no Dart VM service, and a profile APK exposes the service for tree dumps and IO profiles but
  neither expression evaluation nor the widget inspector. Both facts were measured rather than
  assumed
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: flutter-android
- Field benchmark: incomplete
- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none
- Operating systems: android-emulator
- Architectures: x86_64
- Runtimes: Dart VM service (profile-mode build, dump and profile RPCs only), flutter drive
- Frameworks: Flutter
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. Both revisions of LocalSend now
    build profile APKs on the x86_64 executor and the profile observation channel is measured, but
    no scenario, no three affected reproductions and no three fixed controls exist. The scenario
    must observe through a tree dump or an IO profile: the profile build registers 26 extension RPCs
    including debugDumpApp, debugDumpRenderTree and the semantics dumps, exposes no widget
    inspector, and refuses evaluate with 'Debugger is disabled in AOT mode'
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target
  - [environment-unreachable] the campaign host has no x86_64 Android system image, so the arch
    bound is satisfied only on the lane's own x86_64 executor (black@zgx-5a09.local then strix).
    That executor is now proven for this target: both LocalSend revisions build profile APKs for
    android-x64 there and the lane's AVD recipe boots an x86_64 API 36 emulator inside the worker
    image. What is not yet built there is the campaign runner itself, so no scenario has run

## Linux Qt Quick/QML

- Frameworks: Qt Quick/QML
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed, and the two candidates that
    build were both executed against their triggers and did not separate their revisions. kalk
    940abaf versus b452c5a: under de_DE.UTF-8 the affected build already evaluates the comma decimal
    '1,5+1' to '2,5' read through the AT-SPI text interface, because libqalculate parses the
    separator itself, so the normalisation the fix adds changes nothing observable. kclock ac9abd2
    versus 033e713: with a preset seeded into kclockrc the preset row is showing on both revisions,
    so the isMobile gate the fix removes is not gating anything on this worker. Both are discarded
    rather than forced
  - [incomplete-evidence] a third Qt Quick application has to be mined, because the qualified pool
    is now exhausted. marknote needs KF 6.21 against trixie's 6.13; keysmith 477812 is severity
    wishlist rather than a defect; kalk and kclock are the two discarded above. elisa 18e843d versus
    5b191f1 is the only qualified candidate left and its build was started but not completed: it
    wants KF6Codecs and a further chain a music player pulls in, which is materially larger than the
    two calculators. Its trigger is otherwise sound on paper, since the fix removes a key event
    filter and the observable is whether Space toggles a focused player-control button
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

## Linux Qt Widgets

## macOS Accessibility

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: Permissioned macOS accessibility on SwiftUI
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: macos-ax

- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none

- Runtimes: Swift runtime, Accessibility API
- Frameworks: SwiftUI, AppKit
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: missing
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. 9 candidate defects across 5
    independent applications are qualified with verified revisions, but none has three clean
    affected reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

## React Native Android

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: React Native on a reset Android emulator through Appium UiAutomator2
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: react-native-android
- Field benchmark: incomplete
- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none
- Operating systems: android-emulator
- Architectures: x86_64
- Runtimes: Hermes, Appium UiAutomator2
- Frameworks: React Native
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has reached a reproduction. 5 candidate defects
    across 3 applications are qualified with verified revisions, and the four application archives
    the runner needed are now built: joplin assembleProfileable at de637847 and 623da377, and the
    MissingCore/Music assembleRelease x86_64 splits at cdd2305a and 5c86ff15. The runner is executed
    rather than committed unexercised. Its own preflight was unsatisfiable and is fixed, and both
    campaigns then ran on a reset pixel_6 AVD on android-36 google_apis x86_64 inside the pinned
    worker image with Docker network mode none, and both passed their cleanup audit. Both stopped in
    the authored trigger. The music trigger waits for an ARTISTS tab that does not exist at
    cdd2305a, where the tabs are HOME, FOLDERS, PLAYLISTS and TRACKS, and it does not wait for the
    media scan. The joplin trigger reaches the Welcome! notebook row and then cannot address it,
    because find_node walks up to a clickable ancestor and the React Native touchable sets no
    clickable attribute, so the walk reaches the boundless root
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

## React Native iOS

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: React Native on a disposable iOS simulator through Appium XCUITest
- Promotion standard: schema-3
- Native gates: react-native-ios
- Field benchmark: incomplete
- Production-to-local: Unqualified
- Production-to-local evidence: none
- Operating systems: ios-simulator
- Architectures: arm64
- Runtimes: Hermes, Appium XCUITest
- Frameworks: React Native
- Qualifications:
  - cleanCorpus: missing
  - adversarialCorpus: missing
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed, and the qualified pool holds
    one buildable application. All five BlueWallet candidates are disqualified outright:
    package.json pins rn-qr-generator to an exact commit of https://github.com/BlueWallet/rn-qr-
    generator, which returns 404 upstream, so no working tree exists at any candidate revision. The
    Joplin build blocker is closed by execution: under a build root outside the /tmp symlink, with
    DEVELOPMENT_TEAM forced empty and an ad-hoc CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY, both revisions of joplin-note-
    row-touch-target-15972 now reach ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **, produce Joplin.app with differing
    main.jsbundle digests, and launch and survive on a disposable iOS 26.2 simulator on the note
    list the defect lives on. What remains is the accessibility attribute the Joplin note row
    exposes, since an XCUITest predicate on its label does not match a visibly present row, and then
    the six runs; and a second independent application, because a campaign needs two and BlueWallet
    is excluded
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target

## SwiftUI iOS

## Tauri Linux

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: Tauri on Linux WebKitGTK workers
- Promotion standard: schema-3

  - cleanCorpus: evidence
  - adversarialCorpus: evidence
  - packageInstall: ci-gate
  - manualReview: field-benchmark
- Promotion blockers:
  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required independent application campaigns is executed. cc-
    switch issue 4302 has three clean affected reproductions on one identity, three reached-
    observation fixed controls, a minimized trigger, and both controls, and the clean and
    adversarial corpus now measures the oracle on known-good subjects. The second application is
    missing for a measured reason, not an untried one: this probe observes only the WebKitGTK
    webview DOM, and readest and note-gen both need a native GTK window, readest to seed a library
    and note-gen to observe a file chooser. readest builds in the worker and its argv path was
    measured to open books transiently without importing them, so its library cannot be seeded
    through this channel

A Stable target requires exact-commit native evidence, two independent
affected-versus-fixed applications, three clean affected reproductions,
three reached-observation fixed controls, exact identity preservation,
verified minimization, and neighboring legal behavior. Targets on the
schema-3 standard additionally require a clean corpus, an adversarial
corpus, a clean package installation, and a confirmed manual review.
