## Flutter Android

- Maturity: Preview
- Scope: Flutter profile-mode builds on a reset Android emulator. A release APK is AOT compiled with
  no Dart VM service, and a profile APK exposes the service for tree dumps and IO profiles but
  neither expression evaluation nor the widget inspector. Both facts were measured rather than
  assumed

  - [incomplete-evidence] the first application's pair is now verified to discriminate but no
    campaign has been run. LocalSend 3ec2d77 against 9e4a598, issue 2904, separates on the receive
    page: with the message 'https://example.com some extra text' delivered by a prepare-upload
    request on loopback, the affected build shows 'sent you a link:' and the fixed build shows 'sent
    you a message:'. A bare URL stays a link on both revisions, which is the neighbouring legal
    control. What is missing is the campaign runner on the executor, three affected reproductions
    and three fixed controls
  - [incomplete-evidence] only one application is verified and the second is untouched. gopeed
    remains the recorded second candidate and no revision of it has been fetched, built or run
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target. The adversarial subject is already identified and
    measured: a bare URL on the fixed build legitimately produces the link subtitle, which is what
    the defect produces

## macOS Accessibility

- Promotion standard: schema-3

  - [incomplete-evidence] no application campaign has been executed. 9 candidate defects across 5
    independent applications are qualified with verified revisions, but none has three clean
    affected reproductions and three reached-observation fixed controls. An execution attempt on
    2026-08-01 got no further than the first launch: see the environment-unreachable blocker below,
    which is now the input this one waits on
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target
  - [environment-unreachable] the campaign cannot be executed on the only permissioned macOS host,
    and this is the same fault that stalls the required-CI runner rather than a second one. This
    host's syspolicyd has been pinned near 98 percent CPU since 6 July, and it performs Gatekeeper
    assessment, so any Mach-O file that has not been assessed at its current path stalls in
    _dyld_start at 0 percent CPU indefinitely. Ten bounded launches separate what runs from what
    does not: signing, ad-hoc re-signing, architecture, the Rosetta path, the directory, and the
    process that wrote the file all make no difference, and cp of a system binary that runs
    instantly in place also stalls at its new path, so the assessment is keyed on the file rather
    than on the code. It reaches builds too, not only launches: an xcodebuild of Platypus compiled
    and then stopped in a run-script phase with /bin/sh itself stuck in _dyld_start. No application
    can therefore be built or launched, so no reproduction run of any kind is possible. Nothing here
    disqualifies any of the 9 candidates: none was built, no accessibility tree was dumped, and no
    revision pair was tested for discrimination. Repairing syspolicyd needs root

  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required application campaigns is complete. joplin, issue
    15004, affected de637847 and fixed 623da377: three affected reproductions all landing on react-
    native-navigation:hardware-back-exits-app-after-deleted-notebook, three fixed controls all
    returning to the note list, neighbouring legal behaviour holding on both revisions, and a
    passing cleanup audit. MissingCore/Music is discarded rather than retried: with all four
    fixtures confirmed in MediaStore before launch and the media permission granted, its library
    reports zero tracks for the full 300 second bound, which is a property of that application and
    not a gap in the harness. streetwriters/notesnook replaces it and is no longer blocked on a
    build. Both release APKs are built on the strix x86_64 worker, affected 14f727d6 sha256
    0e4cc6f1e804b5a40da4e7e798a3201c9c88bfa2c1e8babc5c5e3b42a2d24805 and fixed 7c3fdab6 sha256
    06302f8e554df5460d2f870a76809dc4c2b8374e269b0ad509d83397f6dc09d8, which needed two inputs
    neither recorded before: Gradle 9.0.0 refuses JDK 21 with a missing JvmVendorSpec.IBM_SEMERU
    field and needs JDK 17, and npm run tx mobile:build has to build the workspace packages before
    the bundle or rspack compiles with 402 unresolved @notesnook imports, emits nothing, and
    repack's CLI exits 0 reporting only an ENOENT on index.bundle. The pair then discriminated on a
    pixel_6 x86_64 AVD inside the pinned worker image, on issue 7348: after one note is linked to
    notebook Alpha and then relinked to Beta in single-select mode, the affected build leaves the
    note row reading Alpha and Beta while the fixed build leaves it reading Beta alone. What is
    missing is the campaign itself: react_native_android_campaign.py has no notesnook observer, so
    no benchmark run has been performed and none is written up
  - [incomplete-evidence] no per-target clean and adversarial corpus gate exists, so no false-
    positive rate is measured for this target. The subjects are chosen and follow from the notesnook
    observable, which is the pair of notebook sets linked before and after the relink: a clean
    subject is the fixed build's plain first link, and the two adversarial subjects are the affected
    build with the selection reverted by the header restore button, and the affected build relinking
    from two already-linked notebooks, where multi-select legitimately keeps them. Both need the
    notesnook observer that the first blocker names

  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required application campaigns is complete, and the corpus
    is retained and passing. joplin, issue 15972, affected 7d90db0b and fixed 2fa45a5a, ran on
    disposable iPhone 16 Pro simulators on iOS 26.2: three affected reproductions all landing on
    react-native-layout:note-row-padding-outside-touch-target with the note row hit area measured at
    370 by 20 and the tap at (201, 118) swallowed, three fixed controls all reaching the same
    observation with the hit area at 402 by 52 and the identical coordinate opening the note,
    neighbouring legal behaviour holding on both revisions, and the owned simulator deleted. The
    corpus is one clean and two adversarial subjects with zero false positives. The second
    application is what remains: BlueWallet is excluded outright because a pinned dependency
    repository returns 404, and streetwriters/notesnook is selected. Its defect is JavaScript, so
    the trigger and the observable proven on Android carry over unchanged: issue 7348, affected
    14f727d6 and fixed 7c3fdab6, one note relinked from notebook Alpha to Beta in single-select
    mode, where the affected build leaves the note in both. Its iOS build is the missing input. The
    bootstrap recipe is now known and is the project's own, npm ci --ignore-scripts then npm run
    bootstrap -- --scope=mobile then npm run tx mobile:build, without which the bundle cannot
    resolve @notesnook/intl. It did not complete on this host: syspolicyd has been wedged near a
    full core since 6 July, a sampled /bin/sh script phase sat in _dyld_start having executed no
    instruction, and the bootstrap and the xcodebuild script phases both stall there repeatedly

  - [incomplete-evidence] one of the two required independent application campaigns is executed. cc-
    switch issue 4302 has three clean affected reproductions on one identity, three reached-
    observation fixed controls, a minimized trigger, and both controls, and the clean and
    adversarial corpus now measures the oracle on known-good subjects. The second application is
    missing for a measured reason, not an untried one: this probe observes only the WebKitGTK
    webview DOM, and readest and note-gen both need a native GTK window, readest to seed a library
    and note-gen to observe a file chooser. readest builds in the worker and its argv path was
    measured to open books transiently without importing them, so its library cannot be seeded
    through this channel

A Stable target requires exact-commit native evidence, two independent
affected-versus-fixed applications, three clean affected reproductions,
three reached-observation fixed controls, exact identity preservation,
verified minimization, and neighboring legal behavior. Targets on the
schema-3 standard additionally require a clean corpus, an adversarial
corpus, a clean package installation, and a confirmed manual review.
